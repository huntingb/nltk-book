I like pizza and apple pie.
It cost $15.50. I work at the D.M.V.
I have a wrist-watch... It cost about $350.00

My name is Bob.
All my life, my name has been Bob (because my parents named me that. Thank you dad!). 
My Dad's name is William Chillingsworth. He admires John F. Kennedy. J.F.K. got shot on November 22, 1963, at 12:30 p.m.

I just found $100 on the ground. Neat!
